### High Priority:

- support specifying font
- For a given bounding box, major pieces should be larger than minor pieces

### Medium Priority:

- specify image size via command line
- specify colors and other config via a JSON file
- utility to print out a set of pieces (or possibly sub-command)

### Low Priority

- better exit codes
- wood-like color/fill pattern
